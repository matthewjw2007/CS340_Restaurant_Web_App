# CS340 Restaurant Web App

## Database Project using Node, Express, MySQL.

## Concept Description:
This is a web application designed for users to create priority lists of restaurants they want to go to. User signs in to create a list of restaurants they want to go to for a particular city, area of a big city, or even a state. The main thing is a user can create several list for their own designated needs an naming it what they want. They can share this with friends who can also add to it and change the order of priority in the list. This means a friend can edit a list that is shared with the user who created and shared it.

### Examples:
* A user wants to make a list for all the restaurants they want to go to in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, they can name it “South Bay, LA” and start adding restaurants.
* A user wants to create a “Vacation Restaurants” list, they can name it that and add several different restaurants from every city they will be stopping in during their vacation.
